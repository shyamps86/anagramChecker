# Anagram Checker

This project contains implementations of an anagram checker in both Java and JavaScript. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Java Implementation

The Java implementation is provided in the `AnagramChecker.java` file. It includes a method to check if two strings are anagrams and a main method to interact with the user via the console.

### How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `AnagramChecker.java`.
3. Compile the Java file:
    ```sh
    javac anagramChecker/AnagramChecker.java
    ```
4. Run the compiled Java program:
    ```sh
    java anagramChecker.AnagramChecker
    ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter two strings and check if they are anagrams.

## JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript implementation is provided in the `anagramChecker.js` file. It includes a function to check if two strings are anagrams and logs the results to the console.

### How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `anagramChecker.js`.
3. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:
    ```sh
    node anagramChecker.js
    ```

The console will display whether the provided example strings are anagrams.

## Example

### Java

```
Enter first string: listen
Enter second string: silent
Yes! anagrams
```

### JavaScript

```
true
false
```

This project demonstrates basic string manipulation and sorting techniques to determine if two strings are anagrams.
